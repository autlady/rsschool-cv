## About me
I do website layout on freelance. The most interesting project was a layout of 16 pages for Center of Business Defence website - I worked hard and it took me a month.  My goal is to become a professional web developer. I think creating a site is an exciting and creative process and I really enjoy it. I never stop learning and improve my skills. I'm not afraid of difficult tasks.
